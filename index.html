          <p>HikeQA understands the importance of cross-browser double checks, for a product to stand and succeed in the competitive Digital Market, <br> and thus employs a mix of real physical devices, and desktop and mobile emulators to test the product on both the high-performing gadgets used by developers, as well as basic devices used by a larger section of the clientele base, to verify the product performance under every circumstance. <br>
            Our team is up to date with the newest trends to solve every testing challenge pertaining to compatibility, functionality, security and user-friendliness. We also maintain older devices and website configurations to test the older versions.</p>
